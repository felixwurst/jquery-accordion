# Accordion in JQuery

[Live Demo](https://felixwurst.github.io/jquery-accordion/)

### Exercise:

The sections of an accordion menu should be opened by clicking on the plus sign at the beginning of each section.
The opened section should receive a minus sign instead of a plus sign. When another section is opened, the previous one should collapse so that only one section is open at a time or all of them are closed. By clicking on the minus sign the section should collapse again.

### Tools:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
