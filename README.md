# 12. JQuery Accordion
## Task 
Each section of an accordion-menu opens by clicking on the plus-sign at the beginning of the section. 
The opened section gets a minus instead of the plus-sign.
If there is another section open it will collapse while open another section,
so there is always just one section open or all are closed.
By clicking on the minus-sign the section collapses again.
